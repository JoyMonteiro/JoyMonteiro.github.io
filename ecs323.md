# Applied Mathematical Methods (ECS323)

This course is intended to give you a flavour of the kind
of scientific problems we encounter in the geosciences,
and the mathematical approaches that we use to model and
solve these problems.

The lectures will be added to the below list, and you can
view them as and when they are uploaded.
