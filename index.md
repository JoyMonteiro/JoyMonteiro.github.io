## About
We aim to be a curiosity-driven group exploring different aspects of weather and climate.
We use a wide range of approaches -- theoretical, computational and observational -- to study
phenomena that we find fascinating. We enjoy working on idealised, abstract questions as well
as applied, socially relevant ones.

We are extremely interested in interdisciplinary research, and encourage looking at questions
from a broader perspective.

## Current interests
We are currently interested in the following themes:
* A fundamental understanding of heat stress events in South Asia.
* [New approaches](https://github.com/CliMT/climt) to climate modelling.
* Rossby wave packets and their role in shaping South Asian climate.

## Teaching
* [Applied Math Methods course ECS323](./ecs323.md) (Aug 2020)
* [Physical Oceanography (ECS461)](./ecs461.md) (Jan 2021)
