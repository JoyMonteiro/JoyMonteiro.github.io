# Physical Oceanography (ECS461)

This course is intended to give you an introduction to
the oceans, their current state, how we observe them,
and some basic theoretical ideas we use to understand them.

The lectures will be added to the below list, and you can
view them as and when they are uploaded.

## Instructions for viewing lectures

On clicking the link for any lecture, you will be directed
to a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentation. At the
bottom of the screen, you will find a play button. Press play,
sit back and let the magic of modern web technologies unfold!

If you want to start the audio from some slide in the middle,
just navigate to that slide (using arrow keys or the space bar),
and then press play. This is useful if you want to revisit some
part of the lecture skipping other parts.
